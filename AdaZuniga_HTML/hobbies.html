                <h3>Ukele:</h3>
                <p>
                    I have always wanted to learn how to 
                    play an instrument but always ended 
                    up prioritizing other things. However, 
                    right when the pandemic started I decided 
                    to buy a ukelele and teach myself how to 
                    play it. I have to say that self-teaching 
                    myself how to play this instrument gave me 
                    so much joy and appreciation for those who
                    have the skill to play it, sometimes sing, 
                    and memorizing chords, strums and songs. 
                    Therefore, if I ever have extra time I get entertain 
                    by learning new songs on my Ukelele!

                <h3>Kickboxing:</h3>
                <p>
                    I used to always be involved in dace classes 
                    an dance team  back in my high school years 
                    but when I started college I wanted to try 
                    something different, so that is when I find 
                    out about kickboxing. <br>
                    After some reaserch abuout the basics of 
                    kickboxing I decided to sing up for classes 
                    right away, and I am so glad I did. 
                    inmediately after the firts month of taking 
                    at least three one hour class of kickboxing 
                    per week I started to notice changes in myself. <br>
                    Kickboxing has a lot of beneffits but the ones 
                    that I was able to experience and enjoiyed the most are: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>burning a lot of calories</li>
                        <li> toning muscles</li>
                        <li>development of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems</li>
                        <li>decrease stress, and</li>
                        <li>improvement in mood</li>
                    </ul>
                    I have been on and off of kickboxing classes   
                    for 4 years now, for this reason I would like 
                    to build a small kickboxing studio once I
                    aquire my own place.

                <h3>Crafts:</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many other things tha I enjoy doing 
                    during my free time but crafting is one that I 
                    have practice for the most time. <br>
                    Crafting has many shapes and forms, and that 
                    is what I like the most about it. 
                    I enjoy crafts not only because my mom introduced  
                    them to me since I was little but becuase there 
                    are many benefits when practicing them such as: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>relax and removing stress</li>
                        <li>satisfaction because I create something with my hands</li>
                        <li>improve mental agility by encourage creativity and decisive thinking</li>
                        <li>improve psychomotor skills because we force our brain to coordinate thought with our hands</li>
                        <li>crafting is a great way to express myself</li>
                        <li>crafts is a wonderful activity to share with anyone</li>
                        <li>Promote recycling and ecology</li>
                        <li>I promote teamwork</li>
                    </ul>
