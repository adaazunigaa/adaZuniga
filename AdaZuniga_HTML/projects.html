                <h3>Doish:</h3>
                <p>
                    Right after graduating from college, I decided 
                    to start a new project by myself, so I choose to 
                    design and develop Doish. 
                    <br> 
                    Doish is an android app that slashes time 
                    consumed tracking everyday activities 
                    avoiding daily toil. <br>
                    The Java-based application developed using 
                    Android studio granted me additional 
                    practice with object-oriented programming 
                    concepts as well as basic knowledge of what it is
                    like to develop a smartphone app. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Automated Tracking App:</h3>
                <p>
                    Tracing daily computer actions provided in
                    sightful data analysis for identifying ways in 
                    which business processes may be automatically 
                    evaluated to identify opportunities where 
                    automation technologies may be applied or where 
                    the process may be simplified. This C# based 
                    application slashed the time to document processes 
                    and where potential efficiencies and savings may 
                    be realized. Effectively, automation leveraging 
                    automation. <br>
                    This project was quite unique since it was already 
                    halfway done. However, I am glad o got to work with 
                    it since it forced me to understand how simple and 
                    important it is to write comments on your code, how 
                    sometimes we can not change things so we need to work 
                    with what we have because at the end of the day our job
                    is to fully understand and deliver a solution to a given 
                    problem.

                <h3>Front end:</h3>
                <p>
                    I have always had an artistic side on 
                    everything I do so programming was not 
                    going to be an exception. During college I 
                    took a variety of courses that focused on 
                    an area of software development but, I learned 
                    to focus on computer imaging. I really enjoyed 
                    the design part of those computer imaging classes 
                    so I wanted to take my learning further and decided 
                    to take a UX class during my last semester of college. 
                    My user interaction class just gave me a brief 
                    introduction to how powerful front end development 
                    is, so I decided to take it further and learn more 
                    about the different faces of front end development. <br>
                    This website was designed and developed with the 
                    purpose of practising front end development all 
                    the way from creating site maps, wireframes, 
                    design (and having a responsive design), development, 
                    UI, Webhosting, domains and databases.
